#### Cycling—in the Direction of Delicious Food, of Course!
Last season, I was able to get 2000km in! But more importantly, I made it to 8 new patios, 6 ice cream shops, 4 beaches, and 2 provinces—all with a new friend I met in grad school!

This season, the goal is 3000km, keeping in mind the need to be covid-wise, but also getting outside as much as possible for my mental health. For me, the best part of riding comes at and after dusk, when you're moving between dense trails and open fields, experiencing the temperature anomalies that accompany the changes in terrain. There is also something to be said about travelling by headlamp after dark—nothing seems to matter much, but the few visable meters ahead.

#### Reading for Pleasure
The covid-19 pandemic has reignited my passion for reading, perhaps in part due to the lack of access to regular social activities. Nevertheless, I took solace in Viktor Frankel's 'Man's Search for Meaning', Tim Wu's 'The Master Switch', and Chris Hadfield's 'An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth', to name a few.

### Experiences
#### The Subtle Art of Being a Bus Driver
Being a bus driver is not always easy. Rush hour can be stressful, people can be rude and inconsiderate, but a few good people can change the course of a tough day too! Over the years, I've been fortunate to visit many of Ottawa's neighborhoods, communities I probably wouldn't have visited had I not been behind the wheel. The fall colours are particularly beautiful in certain parts of the city, like along the Rideau River, which flows north from Upper Rideau Lake and empties into the Ottawa River, at the stunning Rideau Falls. There is never a dull moment driving the bus—I know this because I've driven around the clock, from dawn until dusk and dusk until dawn. My preference is to drive in the evenings. For whatever reason, I find that, in general, people tend to be more peaceful on their way home than when they need to get somewhere 10 minutes ago.
