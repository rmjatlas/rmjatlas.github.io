## Welcome, I'm glad you made it this far!
My goal in preparing this short note is to offer a glimpse into my humble, yet amazing life. Amazing, because of all the extraordinary people I've met along the way.
If you choose to read on, you'll discover some of my interests, experiences, and half-baked ideas—nothing earth-shattering, but you might just trip over something that tickles your fancy.

### Interests
#### Cycling—in the Direction of Delicious Food, of Course!
Last season, I was able to get 1500km in! But more importantly, I made it to 8 new patios, 6 ice cream shops, 4 beaches and 2 provinces—all with a new friend I met in grad school!

This season, the goal is 3000km, keeping in mind the need to be covid-wise, but also getting outside as much as possible for my mental health. For me, the best part of riding comes at and after dusk, when you're moving between dense trails and open fields, experiencing the temperature anomalies that accompany the changes in terrain. There is also something to be said about travelling by headlamp after dark—nothing seems to matter much, save for the few visable meters ahead.

#### Games—Board Games, Card Games, You Name it!
On my shelf:
- Scarbble Jr & Sr
- Catan (base & 5-6 player expansion)
- Tsuro
- Betrayal at the House on the Hill
- Joking Hazard
- Digital Monopoly
- Labyrinth
- Poker Set

Digital:
- Cribbage
- Euchre
- Chess

#### Reading for Pleasure
The covid-19 pandemic has reignited my passion for reading, perhaps in part due to a lack of access to regular social activities. Nevertheless, I took solace in Viktor Frankl's 'Man's Search for Meaning', Tim Wu's 'The Master Switch', and Chris Hadfield's 'An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth', to name a few.

### Experiences
#### The Subtle Art of Being a Bus Driver
Being a bus driver is not always easy. Rush hour can be stressful, people can be rude and inconsiderate, but a few good people can change the course of a tough day, too! Over the years, I've been fortunate to visit many of Ottawa's communities, neighborhoods I probably wouldn't have visited had I not been behind the wheel. The fall colours are particularly beautiful in certain parts of the city, like along the Rideau River, which flows north from Upper Rideau Lake and empties into the Ottawa River, at the stunning Rideau Falls. There is never a dull moment driving the bus—I know this because I've driven around the clock, from dawn until dusk and dusk until dawn. My preference is to drive in the evenings. For whatever reason, it is my experience that, in general, people tend to be more peaceful on their way home than when they need to be somewhere 10 minutes ago.

#### Grad Student Life
Full disclosure: I haven't crossed the finish line just yet. But I'm getting closer every day. I was lucky. I was lucky to get in. I cold-emailed the program director and asked for his blessing to enroll in two graduate-level courses despite not formally being admitted to the program. Soon after I cleared that hurdle, I began to make friends, learn new things, and a year later, I was admitted to the program with credit for the two courses that I'd completed. My initial preference for a thesis supervisor selected another student over me. Admittedly, I studied alongside her the next year, and she was brilliant, an excellent scholar, writer, communicator, she could do it all—and it seems like a sure bet that she will go on to do great things. It was suggested to me that I consider working with Dr. Fraser Taylor, instead. Dr. Taylor graciously took me under his wing, and a short time later, I began to realize the gift I had be given. Here is a man whose kindness knows no bounds, whose list of personal and professional accomplishments can be easily confused with that of an entire academic department, and yet Dr. Taylor took care of me and showed by example how to act with humility and stay humble. I almost don't want this procees to end. Maybe I can prolong this experience by giving my time to further some of the projects currently underway in his lab.

#### How We Get What We Value—This Is a Declarative Statement, Not a Question
- this discussion is currently on the walls in my Ideas Room (a spare bedroom at the rear of my apartment). I hope to bring some ideas out one day soon.

### Credits
To all the people who make me look tall, thank you.
