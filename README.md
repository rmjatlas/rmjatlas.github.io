<h2>Welcome, I'm glad you made it this far!</h2>
My goal in preparing this short note is to offer a glimpse into my humble, yet amazing life. Amazing, because of all the extraordinary people I've met along the way. If you choose to read on, you'll discover some of my interests, experiences, and half-baked ideas—nothing earth-shattering, but you might just trip over something that tickles your fancy. Or, you maybe you'd prefer visit my <a href="https://github.com/rmjatlas">GitHub repositories</a> instead!

<h3>Interests</h3
<h4>Cycling—in the Direction of Delicious Food, of Course!</h4>
Last season, I was able to get 1500km in! But more importantly, I made it to 8 new patios, 6 ice cream shops, and 4 beaches, in 2 provinces—all with a new friend I met in grad school! This season, the goal is 3000km, keeping in mind the need to be covid-wise, but also getting outside as much as possible for my mental health. For me, the best part of riding comes at and after dusk, when you're moving between dense trails and open fields, experiencing the temperature anomalies that accompany the changes in terrain. There is also something to be said about travelling by headlamp after dark—nothing seems to matter much, save for the few visable meters ahead.

<h4>Reading for Pleasure</h4>
The covid-19 pandemic has reignited my passion for reading, perhaps in part due to a lack of access to traditional social activities. Nevertheless, I found comfort in Viktor Frankl's <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>, Tim Wu's <i>The Master Switch</i>, and Chris Hadfield's <i>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth</i>, to name a few.

<h4>The Ottawa Senators—Brady Tkachuk fan boy right here!</h4>
Do you even lift? Five different Ottawa Senators t-shirts make up my gym uniform. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, I sport the retro logo, the current logo or the pride logo, and on Mondays and Fridays, you can find me squatting with the Tkachuk name bar on my back. Why this pattern? It's pretty simple—Brady drags the boys into battle on a regular basis, so on Mondays and Fridays when I might need that extra boost to get going or finish the week off strong, I like to channel my inner warrior and ask: <strong>What would Brady do?</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53eb7ILMLew">The kids are alright!</a>


<h3>Experiences</h3>
<h4>The Subtle Art of Being a Bus Driver</h4>
Being a bus driver is not always easy. Rush hour can be stressful, people can be rude and inconsiderate, but a few good people can change the course of a tough day, too! Over the years, I've been fortunate to visit many of Ottawa's communities, neighborhoods I probably wouldn't have visited had I not been behind the wheel. The fall colours are particularly beautiful in certain parts of the city, like along the Rideau River, which flows north from Upper Rideau Lake and empties into the Ottawa River, at the stunning Rideau Falls. There is never a dull moment driving the bus—I know this because I've driven around the clock, from dawn until dusk and dusk until dawn. My preference is to drive in the evenings. For whatever reason, it is my experience that, in general, people tend to be more peaceful on their way home than when they need to be somewhere 10 minutes ago.

<h4>Grad Student Life</h4>
Full disclosure: I haven't crossed the finish line just yet. But I'm getting closer every day. I was lucky—I was lucky to get in. I cold-emailed the program director and asked for his blessing to enroll in two graduate-level courses despite not formally being admitted to the program. Soon after I cleared that hurdle, I began to make friends, learn new things, and a year later, I was admitted to the program with credit for the two courses that I'd completed. My initial preference for a thesis supervisor selected another student over me. Admittedly, I studied alongside her the next year and she was brilliant; an excellent scholar, writer, communicator, she could do it all—and it seems like a sure bet that she will go on to do great things. It was suggested to me that I consider working with Dr. Fraser Taylor, instead. Dr. Taylor graciously took me under his wing, and a short time later, I began to realize the gift I had been given. Here was a man whose kindness knew no bounds, whose personal and professional accomplishments could easily be confused with that of an entire academic department, yet Dr. Taylor took care of me, he nurtured me and instilled a sense of humility in light of dynamism. I almost don't want this procees to end. Maybe I can prolong this relationship, this experience, by giving my time to some of the projects currently underway in his lab.
